# Module-6-PyViz-Challenge

In this assignment, my job is to use my data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities. In this module, my financial analysis toolkit will continue to grow as you incorporate some technologies required to create sophisticated data visualizations.

Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. My role is as an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.
My job is to use my data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.
 I'll need to create and submit the following deliverable:

A Jupyter notebook that contains my analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.
I will need to use the san_francisco_housing.ipynb notebook to visualize and analyze the real-estate data by using hvPlot and GeoViews. Additionally, I'll need to read the sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv file from the Resources folder into the notebook and to create the DataFrame that Iâ€™ll use in the analysis.

* Calculate and plot the housing units per year.
* Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot.
* Compare the average prices by neighborhood.
* Build an interactive neighborhood map.
* Compose my data story.

## Instructions on how to use 

### 1. Launch san_francisco_housing.ipynb from JuypterLab or Visual Studio Code
* Run through each line of code to view the output
